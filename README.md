# top_words_bot
a reddit bot to point out and rank top words.

###########################3

This bot is going to be a first in practice of version control. At the start of writing this readme, I have no code written. I do, however, plan to play off of my https://github.com/CrazyAnchovy/repeat_after_me_reddit_bot .

I want to analyze and point out the top used words of reddit.

I need to be sensitive to not disrupt conversation, but would still like to get some visibility.

Going to start with just reading all of the comments and printing them

...here I go!
